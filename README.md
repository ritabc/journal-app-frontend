# JournalRecorder - a WIP journal app.

A quick app built to practice React, Redux, and Auth with Google Sign In and JWT. Also uses a [Rails API](https://github.com/ritabc/journal-app-backend) on the backend.

## The Goal

The goal of this JournalRecorder application was to demonstrate a working knowledge of the above tools and frameworks while making a functional application. A new user can come to the site, and after authentication with Google Sign In, the application is 'seeded' with default journals and notes to show a typical use case. In order for the application to be realistically functional for the user, they can choose to 'wipe' the default journals & notes, and create their own journals and notes. Try it out here: https://journal-recorder.herokuapp.com/

## Further TODOs:

- Add search functionality, both across journals and within a journal
- Add Update and Delete functionality, for journals and notes
- Store JWT in browser cookies, allowing the user to refresh the page without having to log back in.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
